        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Spaghetti is one of those feel good foods that always taste delicious! </p>
        <p>This recipe whips ups a quick batch of spaghetti in less than an hour, and 
            works equally well with ground beef or turkey. You can play around with the 
            vegetables too...add celery, bell peppers, or mushrooms to increase the vegetable
            content, or simply use tomatoes and onions.
